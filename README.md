## Motivation

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

## Description

This is an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

* The following HTML routes should be created:
  * GET `/notes` - Should return the `notes.html` file.
  * GET `*` - Should return the `index.html` file

* The application should have a `db.json` file on the backend that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.

* The following API routes should be created:
  * GET `/api/notes` - Should read the `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON.
  * POST `/api/notes` - Should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client.

* DELETE `/api/notes/:id` - Should receive a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete. This means you'll need to find a way to give each note a unique `id` when it's saved. In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the `db.json` file, remove the note with the given `id` property, and then rewrite the notes to the `db.json` file.

## Requirements 

* Functional, deployed application.
* Navbar must be consistent on each page.
